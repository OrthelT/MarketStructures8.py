71,SUBS - WC-EN Bombing Bombers,https://images.evetech.net/types/12038/render?size=64,"Fits for each of the stealth bombers, with roughly the same align time and module layout.

Replace the t1 bomb launcher with a t2 bomb launcher if you can use it, as it is strictly better. Be aware that if you are asked to bring multiple bomb types, you will want to have three bombs loaded instead of four, so that you can swap bombs. If you have 4 bombs in your launcher, you will not be able to swap bombs without first firing one that you have loaded.

Purifier / Hound are preferred over Nemesis / Manticore. If you can only fly a Nemesis or a Manticore, then go with those options.

If you run into fitting issues, you can downgrade the microwarpdrive to a compact on the Nemesis and Manticore fits, as they are tight on fitting.",2024-03-21 23:37:04.976569,2024-06-14 20:24:10.512922
